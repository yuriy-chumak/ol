<H1><A NAME="SEC77">Appendix: Macros</A></H1>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX655"></A>


<P>
This appendix describes an extension to Scheme that allows programs
to define and use new derived expression types.
A derived expression type that has been defined using this extension
is called a <EM>macro</EM>.
<A NAME="IDX656"></A>


<P>
Derived expression types introduced using this extension have
the syntax



<PRE>

(&#60;keyword&#62; &#60;datum&#62;*)

</PRE>

<P>
where &#60;keyword&#62; is an identifier that uniquely determines the
expression type.  This identifier is called the <EM>syntactic
keyword</EM>, or simply <EM>keyword</EM>, of the macro.  The
<A NAME="IDX657"></A>
<A NAME="IDX658"></A>
<A NAME="IDX659"></A>
number of the &#60;datum&#62;s, and their syntax, depends on the
expression type.


<P>
Each instance of a macro is called a <EM>use</EM>
<A NAME="IDX660"></A>
of the macro.
The set of rules, or more generally the procedure, that specifies
how a use of a macro is transcribed into a more primitive expression
is called the <EM>transformer</EM>
<A NAME="IDX661"></A>
of the macro.


<P>
The extension described here consists of three parts:



<UL>

<LI>

A set of expressions used to establish that certain identifiers
are macro keywords, associate them with macro transformers, and control
the scope within which a macro is defined,

<LI>

a convenient pattern language that makes it easy to write
transformers for most macros, and

<LI>

a compatible low-level macro facility for writing macro
transformers that cannot be expressed by the pattern language.

</UL>

<P>
With this extension, there are no reserved identifiers.  The syntactic
keyword of a macro may shadow variable bindings, and local variable
bindings may shadow keyword bindings.   All macros
defined using the pattern language are "hygienic" and
"referentially transparent":
<A NAME="IDX662"></A>


<P>
<A NAME="IDX663"></A>



<UL>

<LI>

If a macro transformer inserts a binding for an identifier
(variable or keyword), the identifier will in effect be renamed
throughout its scope to avoid conflicts with other identifiers.

<LI>

If a macro transformer inserts a free reference to an
identifier, the reference refers to the binding that was visible
where the transformer was specified, regardless of any local
bindings that may surround the use of the macro.

</UL>

<P>
This appendix is divided into three major sections.  The first
section describes the expressions and definitions used to
introduce macros, i.e. to bind identifiers to macro
transformers.


<P>
The second section describes the pattern language.  This pattern
language is sufficient to specify most macro transformers, including
those for all the derived expression types from
section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC32">4.2 Derived expression types</A>.  The primary limitation of the pattern
language is that it is thoroughly hygienic, and thus cannot express
macros that bind identifiers implicitly.


<P>
The third section describes a low-level macro facility that could be
used to implement the pattern language described in the second
section.  This low-level facility is also capable of expressing
non-hygienic macros and other macros whose transformers cannot be
described by the pattern language, and is important as an example of a
more powerful facility that can co-exist with the high-level pattern
language.


<P>
The particular low-level facility described in the third
section is but one of several low-level facilities that have been
designed and implemented to complement the pattern language described
in the second section.  The design of such low-level macro facilities
remains an active area of research, and descriptions of alternative
low-level facilities will be published in subsequent documents.




<H2><A NAME="SEC78">Binding syntactic keywords</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX664"></A>


<P>
<SAMP>`Define-syntax'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`let-syntax'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`letrec-syntax'</SAMP> are
analogous to <SAMP>`define'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`let'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`letrec'</SAMP>, but they bind
syntactic keywords to macro transformers instead of binding variables
to locations that contain values.  Furthermore, there is no <SAMP>`define-syntax'</SAMP> analogue of the internal definitions described in
section <A HREF="r4rs_7.html#SEC43">5.2.2 Internal definitions</A>.



<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Rationale:</EM>
As discussed below, the syntax and scope rules for definitions
give rise to syntactic ambiguities when syntactic keywords are
not reserved.
Further ambiguities would arise if <SAMP>`define-syntax'</SAMP>
were permitted at the beginning of a &#60;body&#62;, with scope
rules analogous to those for internal definitions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
These new expression types and the pattern language described in
section <A HREF="r4rs_12.html#SEC79">Pattern language</A> are added to Scheme by augmenting the
BNF in section <A HREF="r4rs_9.html#SEC66">7.1 Formal syntax</A> with the following new productions.  Note
that the identifier <SAMP>`...'</SAMP> used in some of these productions is not
a metasymbol.

<P>
Although macros may expand into definitions in any context that permits
definitions, it is an error for a definition to shadow a syntactic
keyword whose meaning is needed to determine whether some definition in
the group of top-level or internal definitions that contains the
shadowing definition is in fact a definition, or is needed to determine
the boundary between the group and the expressions that follow the
group.  For example, the following are errors:



<PRE>

(define define 3)

(begin (define begin list))

(let-syntax
  ((foo (syntax-rules ()
          ((foo (proc args ...) body ...)
           (define proc

<TT>(&#60;pattern&#62; &#60;template&#62;)
</TT>
</PRE>

<P>
where the &#60;pattern&#62; and &#60;template&#62; are as in the grammar
above.


<P>
<EM>Semantics:</EM> An instance of <SAMP>`syntax-rules'</SAMP> produces a new macro
transformer by specifying a sequence of hygienic rewrite rules.  A use
of a macro whose keyword is associated with a transformer specified by
<SAMP>`syntax-rules'</SAMP> is matched against the patterns contained in the
&#60;syntax rule&#62;s, beginning with the leftmost &#60;syntax rule&#62;.
When a match is found, the macro use is transcribed hygienically
according to the template.


<P>
Each pattern begins with the keyword for the macro.  This keyword
is not involved in the matching and is not considered a pattern
variable or literal identifier.



<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Rationale:</EM>
The scope of the keyword is determined by the expression or syntax
definition that binds it to the associated macro transformer.
If the keyword were a pattern variable or literal identifier, then
the template that follows the pattern would be within its scope
regardless of whether the keyword were bound by <SAMP>`let-syntax'</SAMP>
or by <SAMP>`letrec-syntax'</SAMP>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
An identifier that appears in the pattern of a &#60;syntax rule&#62; is
a pattern variable, unless it is the keyword that begins the pattern,
is listed in &#60;literals&#62;, or is the identifier "<SAMP>`...'</SAMP>".
Pattern variables match arbitrary input elements and
are used to refer to elements of the input in the template.  It is an
error for the same pattern variable to appear more than once in a
&#60;pattern&#62;.


<P>
Identifiers that appear in &#60;literals&#62; are interpreted as literal
identifiers to be matched against corresponding subforms of the input.
A subform
in the input matches a literal identifier if and only if it is an
identifier
and either both its occurrence in the macro expression and its
occurrence in the macro definition have the same lexical binding, or
the two identifiers are equal and both have no lexical binding.


<P>
A subpattern followed by <SAMP>`...'</SAMP> can match zero or more elements of the
input.  It is an error for <SAMP>`...'</SAMP> to appear in &#60;literals&#62;.
Within a pattern the identifier <SAMP>`...'</SAMP> must follow the last element of
a nonempty sequence of subpatterns.


<P>
More formally, an input form F matches a pattern P if and only if:



<UL>

<LI>

P is a pattern variable; or

<LI>

P is a literal identifier and F is an identifier with the same
binding; or

<LI>

P is a pattern list <SAMP>`(P_1 ... P_n)'</SAMP> and F is a
list of n
forms that match P_1 through P_n, respectively; or

<LI>

P is an improper pattern list
<SAMP>`(P_1 P_2 ... P_n . P_n+1)'</SAMP>
and F is a list or
improper list of n or more forms that match P_1 through P_n,
respectively, and whose nth "cdr" matches P_n+1; or

<LI>

P is 
      of the form
<SAMP>`(P_1 ... P_n P_n+1 &#60;ellipsis&#62;)'</SAMP>
where &#60;ellipsis&#62; is the identifier <SAMP>`...'</SAMP>
and F is
a proper list of at least n elements, the first n of which match
P_1 through P_n, respectively, and each remaining element of F
matches P_n+1; or

<LI>

P is a pattern datum and F is equal to P in the sense of
the <SAMP>`equal?'</SAMP> procedure.

</UL>

<P>
It is an error to use a macro keyword, within the scope of its
binding, in an expression that does not match any of the patterns.


<P>
When a macro use is transcribed according to the template of the
matching &#60;syntax rule&#62;, pattern variables that occur in the
template are replaced by the subforms they match in the input.
Pattern variables that occur in subpatterns followed by one or more
instances of the identifier
<SAMP>`...'</SAMP> are allowed only in subtemplates that are
followed by as many instances of <SAMP>`...'</SAMP>.
They are replaced in the
output by all of the subforms they match in the input, distributed as
indicated.  It is an error if the output cannot be built up as
specified.


<P>
Identifiers that appear in the template but are not pattern variables
or the identifier
<SAMP>`...'</SAMP> are inserted into the output as literal identifiers.  If a
literal identifier is inserted as a free identifier then it refers to the
binding of that identifier within whose scope the instance of
<SAMP>`syntax-rules'</SAMP> appears.
If a literal identifier is inserted as a bound identifier then it is
in effect renamed to prevent inadvertent captures of free identifiers.

The last example is not an error because the local variable <SAMP>`=&#62;'</SAMP>

<H2><A NAME="SEC80">A compatible low-level macro facility</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX670"></A>


<P>
Although the pattern language provided by <SAMP>`syntax-rules'</SAMP> is the
preferred way to specify macro transformers, other low-level
facilities may be provided to specify more complex macro transformers.
In fact, <SAMP>`syntax-rules'</SAMP> can itself be defined as a macro using the
low-level facilities described in this section.


<P>
The low-level macro facility described here introduces <SAMP>`syntax'</SAMP>
as a new syntactic keyword analogous to <SAMP>`quote'</SAMP>, and allows a
&#60;transformer spec&#62; to be any expression.  This is accomplished by
adding the following two productions to the productions in
section <A HREF="r4rs_9.html#SEC66">7.1 Formal syntax</A> and in section <A HREF="r4rs_12.html#SEC78">Binding syntactic keywords</A> above.



<PRE>
<TT>&#60;expression&#62; --&#62; (syntax &#60;datum&#62;)
&#60;transformer spec&#62; --&#62; &#60;expression&#62;</TT>

</PRE>

<P>
The low-level macro system also adds the following procedures:



<PRE>

unwrap-syntax          identifier-&#62;symbol
identifier?            generate-identifier
free-identifier=?      construct-identifier
bound-identifier=?

</PRE>

<P>
Evaluation of a program proceeds in two logical steps.  First the
program is converted into an intermediate language via macro-expansion,
and then the result of macro expansion is evaluated.  When it is
necessary to distinguish the second stage of this process from the
full evaluation process, it is referred to as "execution."


<P>
Syntax definitions, either lexical or global, cause an identifier to
be treated as a keyword within the scope of the binding.  The keyword
is associated with a transformer, which may be created implicitly
using the pattern language of <SAMP>`syntax-rules'</SAMP> or explicitly using
the low-level facilities described below.


<P>
Since a transformer spec must be fully evaluated during the
course of expansion, it is necessary to specify the environment in
which this evaluation takes place.  A transformer spec is
expanded in the same environment as that in which the program is being
expanded, but is executed in an environment that is distinct from the
environment in which the program is executed.  This execution
environment distinction is important only for the resolution of global
variable references and assignments.  In what follows, the environment
in which transformers are executed is called the standard transformer
environment and is assumed to be a standard Scheme environment.


<P>
Since part of the task of hygienic macro expansion is to resolve
identifier references, the fact that transformers are expanded in the
same environment as the program means that identifier bindings in the
program can shadow identifier uses within transformers.  Since
variable bindings in the program are not available at the time the
transformer is executed, it is an error for a transformer to reference
or assign them.  However, since keyword bindings are available during
expansion, lexically visible keyword bindings from the program may be
used in macro uses in a transformer.


<P>
When a macro use is encountered, the macro transformer associated with
the macro keyword is applied to a representation of the macro
expression.  The result returned by the macro transformer replaces the
original expression and is expanded once again.  Thus macro expansions
may themselves be or contain macro uses.


<P>
The syntactic representation passed to a macro transformer
encapsulates information about the structure of the represented form
and the bindings of the identifiers it contains.  These syntax objects
can be traversed and examined using the procedures described below.
The output of a transformer may be built up using the usual Scheme
list constructors, combining pieces of the input with new syntactic
structures.

<SAMP>`Syntax'</SAMP> is the syntactic analogue of <SAMP>`quote'</SAMP>.  It creates a
syntactic representation of &#60;datum&#62; that, like an argument to a
transformer, contains information about the bindings for identifiers
contained in &#60;datum&#62;.  The binding for an identifier introduced
by <SAMP>`syntax'</SAMP> is the closest lexically visible binding.  All
variables and keywords introduced by transformers must be created by
<SAMP>`syntax'</SAMP>.  It is an error to insert a symbol in the output of a
transformation procedure unless it is to be part of a quoted datum.

The second <SAMP>`quote-quote'</SAMP> example results in an error because two raw

first <SAMP>`quote-quote'</SAMP> example does not cause an error because it will
be a quoted datum.

<P>
The last two examples are errors because in both cases a lexically
bound identifier is placed outside of the scope of its binding.
In the first case, the variable <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> is placed outside its scope.
In the second case, the keyword <SAMP>`beta'</SAMP> is placed outside its
scope.

<TT>(let-syntax ((alpha (syntax-rules ()
                      ((alpha) 0))))

</TT>
</PRE>

<P>
The last example is an error because the reference to <SAMP>`list'</SAMP> in the
transformer is shadowed by the lexical binding for <SAMP>`list'</SAMP>.  Since the
expansion process is distinct from the execution of the program,
transformers cannot reference program variables.  On the other hand,
the previous example is not an error because definitions for keywords
in the program do exist at expansion time.

<SAMP>`Generate-identifier'</SAMP> is used to

<P>
Creates and returns an identifier named by <VAR>symbol</VAR> that behaves
as if it had been introduced where the identifier <VAR>id</VAR> was
introduced.


<P>
<SAMP>`Construct-identifier'</SAMP> is used to circumvent hygiene by
creating an identifier that behaves as though it had been
implicitly present in some expression.  For example, the
transformer for a structure
definition macro might construct the name of a field accessor
that does not explicitly appear in a use of the macro,
but can be
constructed from the names of the structure and the field.
If a binding for the field accessor were introduced
by a hygienic transformer, then it would be renamed automatically,
so that the introduced binding would fail to capture any
references to the field accessor that were present in the
input and were intended to be
within the scope of the introduced binding.


<P>
Another example is a macro that implicitly binds <SAMP>`exit'</SAMP>:



<PRE>
<TT>(define-syntax loop-until-exit
  (lambda (x)
    (let ((exit (construct-identifier
                 (car (unwrap-syntax x))

(let ((x 0) (y 1000))
  (loop-until-exit

<P>
The extension described in this appendix is the most
sophisticated macro facility that has ever been proposed
for a block-structured programming language.  The main ideas
come from
Eugene Kohlbecker's PhD thesis on hygienic macro expansion
<A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB51">[Kohlbecker86]</A>, written under the direction of Dan
Friedman <A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB52">[hygienic]</A>, and from the work by Alan Bawden
and Jonathan Rees on syntactic closures <A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB6">[Bawden88]</A>.
Pattern-directed macro facilities were popularized by Kent
Dybvig's non-hygienic implementation of <SAMP>`extend-syntax'</SAMP>
<A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB15">[Dybvig87]</A>.


<P>
At the 1988 meeting of this report's authors at Snowbird,
a macro committee consisting of Bawden, Rees, Dybvig,
and Bob Hieb was charged with developing a hygienic macro
facility akin to <SAMP>`extend-syntax'</SAMP> but based on syntactic closures.
Chris Hanson implemented a prototype and wrote a paper on his
experience, pointing out that an implementation based on
syntactic closures must determine the syntactic roles of some
identifiers before macro expansion based on textual pattern
matching can make those roles apparent.  William Clinger
observed that Kohlbecker's algorithm amounts to a technique
for delaying this determination, and proposed a more efficient
version of Kohlbecker's algorithm.  Pavel Curtis spoke up for
referentially transparent local macros.  Rees merged syntactic
environments with the modified Kohlbecker's algorithm and
implemented it all, twice <A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB13">[macrosthatwork]</A>.


<P>
Dybvig and Hieb designed and implemented the low-level
macro facility described above.
Recently Hanson and Bawden have extended syntactic closures
to obtain an alternative low-level macro facility.
The macro committee has not endorsed any particular
low-level facility, but does endorse the general concept of
a low-level facility that is compatible with the
high-level pattern language described in this appendix.


<P>
Several other people have contributed by working on macros
over the years.  Hal Abelson contributed by holding this
report hostage to the appendix on macros.
