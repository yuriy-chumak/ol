Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of
feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional
features appear necessary.  Scheme demonstrates that a very small number
of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are
composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language
that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming
paradigms in use today.


<P>
Scheme
was one of the first programming languages to incorporate first class
procedures as in the lambda calculus, thereby proving the usefulness of
static scope rules and block structure in a dynamically typed language.
Scheme was the first major dialect of Lisp to distinguish procedures
from lambda expressions and symbols, to use a single lexical
environment for all variables, and to evaluate the operator position
of a procedure call in the same way as an operand position.  By relying
entirely on procedure calls to express iteration, Scheme emphasized the
fact that tail-recursive procedure calls are essentially goto's that
pass arguments.  Scheme was the first widely used programming language to
embrace first class escape procedures, from which all previously known
sequential control structures can be synthesized.  More recently, building
upon the design of generic arithmetic in Common Lisp, Scheme introduced
the concept of exact and inexact numbers.
With the appendix to this report Scheme becomes the first programming
language to support hygienic macros, which permit the syntax of a
block-structured language to be extended reliably.

The first description of Scheme was written in
1975 <A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB91">[Scheme75]</A>.  A revised report <A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB85">[Scheme78]</A>
 appeared in 1978, which described the evolution
of the language as its MIT implementation was upgraded to support an
innovative compiler <A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB80">[Rabbit]</A>.  Three distinct projects began in
1981 and 1982 to use variants of Scheme for courses at MIT, Yale, and
Indiana University <A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB66">[Rees82]</A>, <A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB57">[MITScheme]</A>, <A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB34">[Scheme311]</A>.  An introductory
computer science textbook using Scheme was published in
1984 <A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB2">[SICP]</A>.


<P>
As Scheme became more widespread,
local dialects began to diverge until students and researchers
occasionally found it difficult to understand code written at other
sites.
Fifteen representatives of the major implementations of Scheme therefore
met in October 1984 to work toward a better and more widely accepted
standard for Scheme.


<P>
Their report <A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB8">[RRRS]</A>
was published at MIT and Indiana University in the summer of 1985.
Another round of revision took place in the spring of 1986 <A HREF="r4rs_13.html#BIB68">[R3RS]</A>.
The present report reflects further revisions agreed upon in a meeting
that preceded the 1988 ACM Conference on Lisp and Functional Programming
and in subsequent electronic mail.


<P>
We intend this report to belong to the entire Scheme community, and so
we grant permission to copy it in whole or in part without fee.  In
particular, we encourage implementors of Scheme to use this report as
a starting point for manuals and other documentation, modifying it as
necessary.
