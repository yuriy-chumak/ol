<H2><A NAME="SEC73">Language changes</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX578"></A>


<P>
This section enumerates the changes that have been made to Scheme since
the "Revised revised report" <A HREF="r3rs_12.html#BIB4">[RRRS]</A> was published.



<UL>

<LI>

The character <TT>^</TT> (circumflex) is now an extended
alphabetic character

<LI>

The objects returned by literal expressions are permitted to be
immutable

<LI>

The list to which a rest-argument becomes bound must be newly allocated

<LI>

<CODE>Do</CODE> variables are updated by rebinding rather than by
assignment

<LI>

New expression type: <CODE>delay</CODE>

<LI>

Quasiquote (backquote) has been improved in several ways:
vectors are allowed; nesting is allowed; and an external syntax for
quasiquote expressions (analogous to that for <CODE>quote</CODE>) has been
defined

<LI>

The semantics of definitions of the form
<TT>(define (&#60;variable&#62; &#60;formals&#62;) &#60;body&#62;)</TT>
no longer involves an implicit <TT>rec</TT> or <TT>letrec</TT>

<LI>

The "curried" definition syntax has been removed

<LI>

The boolean constants are now written <TT>#t</TT> and <TT>#f</TT>
instead of <TT>#!true</TT> and <TT>#!false</TT>

<LI>

The syntax <TT>#!null</TT> (for the empty list) has
been removed

<LI>

New procedures: <CODE>boolean?</CODE>, <CODE>procedure?</CODE>, and <CODE>force</CODE>

<LI>

The value of <CODE>eq?</CODE> on numbers and characters is now unspecified

<LI>

<CODE>Eq?</CODE> and <CODE>eqv?</CODE> now explicitly permit operationally equivalent
procedures to be identified

<LI>

<CODE>Eqv?</CODE> distinguishes exact numbers from inexact ones, even if they
are equal according to <CODE>=</CODE>

<LI>

List, string, and vector indexes must be <EM>exact</EM> integers

<LI>

<CODE>Atan</CODE> now admits either one or two arguments

<LI>

Expression types removed: <TT>named-lambda</TT>, <TT>rec</TT>, <TT>sequence</TT>

<LI>

Procedures removed: <TT>append!</TT>, <TT>string-null?</TT>, <TT>substring-fill!</TT>, <TT>substring-move-left!</TT>, <TT>substring-move-right!</TT>, <TT>object-hash</TT>, <TT>object-unhash</TT>, <TT>1+</TT>, <TT>-1+</TT>

<LI>

Redundant procedure names removed: <TT>&#60;?</TT>, <TT>&#60;=?</TT>, <TT>=?</TT>,
<TT>&#62;?</TT>, and <TT>&#62;=?</TT>

</UL>

<H2><A NAME="SEC74">Keywords as variable names</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX592"></A>


<P>
Some implementations allow arbitrary syntactic
keywords to be used as variable
<A NAME="IDX593"></A>
<A NAME="IDX594"></A>
names, instead of reserving them, as this report would have
it. But this creates ambiguities in the interpretation
<A NAME="IDX595"></A>
of expressions: for example, in the following, it's not clear whether
the expression <TT>(if 1 2 3)</TT> should be treated as a procedure call or
as a conditional.



<PRE>

(define if list)
(if 1 2 3)                             ==&#62;  2 <EM></EM>or (1 2 3)

</PRE>

<P>
These ambiguities are usually resolved in some consistent way within any
given implementation, but no particular treatment stands out as being
clearly superior to any other, so these situations were excluded for the
purposes of this report.




<H2><A NAME="SEC75">Macros</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX596"></A>


<P>
Scheme does not have any standard facility for defining new kinds of
expressions.


<P>
The ability to alter the syntax of the language creates
numerous problems.  All current implementations of Scheme have macro
facilities that solve those problems to one degree or another, but the
solutions are quite different and it isn't clear at this time which
solution is best, or indeed whether any of the solutions are truly
adequate.  Rather than standardize, we are encouraging implementations
to continue to experiment with different solutions.


<P>
The main problems with traditional macros are: They must be
defined to the system before any code using them is loaded; this is a
common source of obscure bugs.  They are usually global; macros can be
made to follow lexical scope rules 
, but many people find the resulting scope rules
confusing.  Unless they are written very carefully, macros are
vulnerable to inadvertant capture of free variables; to get around this,
for example, macros may have to generate code in which procedure values
appear as quoted constants.  There is a similar problem with syntactic
keywords if the keywords of special forms are not reserved.  If keywords
are reserved, then either macros introduce new reserved words,
invalidating old code, or else special forms defined by the programmer
do not have the same status as special forms defined by the system.
