<P>
Expression types are categorized as <EM>primitive</EM> or <EM>derived</EM>.
Primitive expression types include variables and procedure calls.
Derived expression types are not semantically primitive, but can instead
be defined as macros.
With the exception of <SAMP>`quasiquote'</SAMP>, whose macro definition is complex,
the derived expressions are classified as library features.
Suitable definitions are given in section <A HREF="r5rs_9.html#SEC80">7.3 Derived expression types</A>.

<P>
An expression consisting of a variable
<A NAME="IDX84"></A>
(section see section <A HREF="r5rs_5.html#SEC19">3.1 Variables; syntactic keywords; and regions</A>) is a variable reference.  The value of
the variable reference is the value stored in the location to which the
variable is bound.  It is an error to reference an
unbound variable.

&#60;Datum&#62;
may be any external representation of a Scheme object (see

As noted in section <A HREF="r5rs_5.html#SEC22">3.4 Storage model</A>, it is an error to alter a constant

<DD><A NAME="IDX92"></A>


<P>
A procedure call is written by simply enclosing in parentheses
expressions for the procedure to be called and the arguments to be
passed to it.  The operator and operand expressions are evaluated (in an
unspecified order) and the resulting procedure is passed the resulting
arguments.

</TT>
</PRE>

<P>
A number of procedures are available as the values of variables in the
initial environment; for example, the addition and multiplication
procedures in the above examples are the values of the variables <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>.  New procedures are created by evaluating lambda expressions
(see section see section <A HREF="r5rs_6.html#SEC29">4.1.4 Procedures</A>).


<P>
Procedure calls may return any number of values (see <CODE>values</CODE> in
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>
section see section <A HREF="r5rs_8.html#SEC64">6.4 Control features</A>).  With the exception of <SAMP>`values'</SAMP>
the procedures available in the initial environment return one
value or, for procedures such as <SAMP>`apply'</SAMP>, pass on the values returned
by a call to one of their arguments.


<P>
Procedure calls are also called <EM>combinations</EM>.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX96"></A>



<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM> In contrast to other dialects of Lisp, the order of
evaluation is unspecified, and the operator expression and the operand
expressions are always evaluated with the same evaluation rules.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM>
Although the order of evaluation is otherwise unspecified, the effect of
any concurrent evaluation of the operator and operand expressions is
constrained to be consistent with some sequential order of evaluation.
The order of evaluation may be chosen differently for each procedure call.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM> In many dialects of Lisp, the empty combination, <TT>()</TT>, is a legitimate expression.  In Scheme, combinations must have at
least one subexpression, so <TT>()</TT> is not a syntactically valid
expression.

<P>
<EM>Syntax:</EM>
&#60;Formals&#62; should be a formal arguments list as described below,
and &#60;body&#62; should be a sequence of one or more expressions.


<P>
<EM>Semantics:</EM>
A lambda expression evaluates to a procedure.  The environment in
effect when the lambda expression was evaluated is remembered as part of the
procedure.  When the procedure is later called with some actual
arguments, the environment in which the lambda expression was evaluated will
be extended by binding the variables in the formal argument list to
fresh locations, the corresponding actual argument values will be stored
in those locations, and the expressions in the body of the lambda expression
will be evaluated sequentially in the extended environment.
The result(s) of the last expression in the body will be returned as
the result(s) of the procedure call.



<PRE>

(add4 6)                               ==&#62;  10
</EM>
</PRE>

<P>
&#60;Formals&#62; should have one of the following forms:



<UL>

<LI>

<TT>(&#60;variable1&#62; ...)</TT>:
The procedure takes a fixed number of arguments; when the procedure is
called, the arguments will be stored in the bindings of the
corresponding variables.

<LI>

&#60;variable&#62;:
The procedure takes any number of arguments; when the procedure is
called, the sequence of actual arguments is converted into a newly
allocated list, and the list is stored in the binding of the
&#60;variable&#62;.

<LI>

<TT>(&#60;variable1&#62; ... &#60;variable_n&#62; <B>.</B>
&#60;variable_n+1&#62;)</TT>:
If a space-delimited period precedes the last variable, then
the procedure takes n or more arguments, where n is the
number of formal arguments before the period (there must
be at least one).
The value stored in the binding of the last variable will be a
newly allocated
list of the actual arguments left over after all the other actual
arguments have been matched up against the other formal arguments.

</UL>

<P>
It is an error for a &#60;variable&#62; to appear more than once in
&#60;formals&#62;.

evaluated in order, and the result(s) of the last &#60;expression&#62; in the

<SAMP>`Do'</SAMP> is an iteration construct.  It specifies a set of variables to

the loop exits after evaluating the &#60;expression&#62;s.

The &#60;init&#62; expressions are evaluated (in some unspecified order),
the &#60;variable&#62;s are bound to fresh locations, the results of the

&#60;variable&#62;s, and the next iteration begins.


<P>
If &#60;test&#62; evaluates to a true value, then the
&#60;expression&#62;s are evaluated from left to right and the value(s) of
the last &#60;expression&#62; is(are) returned.  If no &#60;expression&#62;s

evaluated ("unquoted") and its result is inserted into the structure
instead of the comma and the expression.  If a comma appears followed

at-sign should only appear within a list or vector &#60;qq template&#62;.

Program-defined expression types have the syntax



<PRE>

(&#60;keyword&#62; &#60;datum&#62; ...)

</PRE>

<P>
where &#60;keyword&#62; is an identifier that uniquely determines the
expression type.  This identifier is called the <EM>syntactic

<A NAME="IDX152"></A>
<A NAME="IDX153"></A>
<A NAME="IDX154"></A>
number of the &#60;datum&#62;s, and their syntax, depends on the
expression type.


<P>
Each instance of a macro is called a <EM>use</EM>
<A NAME="IDX155"></A>
of the macro.
The set of rules that specifies
how a use of a macro is transcribed into a more primitive expression
is called the <EM>transformer</EM>
<A NAME="IDX156"></A>
of the macro.


<P>
The macro definition facility consists of two parts:



<UL>

<LI>

A set of expressions used to establish that certain identifiers
are macro keywords, associate them with macro transformers, and control
the scope within which a macro is defined, and

<LI>

a pattern language for specifying macro transformers.

</UL>

<P>
The syntactic keyword of a macro may shadow variable bindings, and local
variable bindings may shadow keyword bindings.    All macros
defined using the pattern language  are "hygienic" and "referentially
transparent" and thus preserve Scheme's lexical scoping <A HREF="r5rs_13.html#BIB14">[Kohlbecker86]</A>, [
hygienic], <A HREF="r5rs_13.html#BIB2">[Bawden88]</A>, <A HREF="r5rs_13.html#BIB7">[macrosthatwork]</A>, <A HREF="r5rs_13.html#BIB9">[syntacticabstraction]</A>:


<P>
<A NAME="IDX157"></A>


<P>
<A NAME="IDX158"></A>



<UL>

<LI>

If a macro transformer inserts a binding for an identifier
(variable or keyword), the identifier will in effect be renamed
throughout its scope to avoid conflicts with other identifiers.
Note that a <CODE>define</CODE> at top level may or may not introduce a binding;
see section <A HREF="r5rs_7.html#SEC44">5.2 Definitions</A>.

<LI>

If a macro transformer inserts a free reference to an
identifier, the reference refers to the binding that was visible
where the transformer was specified, regardless of any local
bindings that may surround the use of the macro.

<TT>(&#60;element&#62; ...)
(&#60;element&#62; &#60;element&#62; ... . &#60;template&#62;)
#(&#60;element&#62; ...)
</TT>
</PRE>

<P>
where an &#60;element&#62; is a &#60;template&#62; optionally
followed by an &#60;ellipsis&#62; and
an &#60;ellipsis&#62; is the identifier "<SAMP>`...'</SAMP>" (which cannot be used as
an identifier in either a template or a pattern).
<A NAME="IDX165"></A>


<P>
<EM>Semantics:</EM> An instance of <SAMP>`syntax-rules'</SAMP> produces a new macro
transformer by specifying a sequence of hygienic rewrite rules.  A use
of a macro whose keyword is associated with a transformer specified by
<SAMP>`syntax-rules'</SAMP> is matched against the patterns contained in the
&#60;syntax rule&#62;s, beginning with the leftmost &#60;syntax rule&#62;.
When a match is found, the macro use is transcribed hygienically
according to the template.


<P>
An identifier that appears in the pattern of a &#60;syntax rule&#62; is
a <EM>pattern variable</EM>, unless it is the keyword that begins the pattern,
is listed in &#60;literals&#62;, or is the identifier "<SAMP>`...'</SAMP>".
Pattern variables match arbitrary input elements and
are used to refer to elements of the input in the template.  It is an
error for the same pattern variable to appear more than once in a
&#60;pattern&#62;.


<P>
The keyword at the beginning of the pattern in a
&#60;syntax rule&#62; is not involved in the matching and
is not considered a pattern variable or literal identifier.



<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Rationale:</EM>
The scope of the keyword is determined by the expression or syntax
definition that binds it to the associated macro transformer.
If the keyword were a pattern variable or literal
identifier, then
the template that follows the pattern would be within its scope
regardless of whether the keyword were bound by <SAMP>`let-syntax'</SAMP>
or by <SAMP>`letrec-syntax'</SAMP>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Identifiers that appear in &#60;literals&#62; are interpreted as literal
identifiers to be matched against corresponding subforms of the input.
A subform
in the input matches a literal identifier if and only if it is an
identifier
and either both its occurrence in the macro expression and its
occurrence in the macro definition have the same lexical binding, or
the two identifiers are equal and both have no lexical binding.


<P>
A subpattern followed by <SAMP>`...'</SAMP> can match zero or more elements of the
input.  It is an error for <SAMP>`...'</SAMP> to appear in &#60;literals&#62;.
Within a pattern the identifier <SAMP>`...'</SAMP> must follow the last element of
a nonempty sequence of subpatterns.


<P>
More formally, an input form F matches a pattern P if and only if:



<UL>

<LI>

P is a non-literal identifier; or

<LI>

P is a literal identifier and F is an identifier with the same
binding; or

<LI>

P is a list <SAMP>`(P_1 ... P_n)'</SAMP> and F is a
list of n
forms that match P_1 through P_n, respectively; or

<LI>

P is an improper list
<SAMP>`(P_1 P_2 ... P_n . P_n+1)'</SAMP>
and F is a list or
improper list of n or more forms that match P_1 through P_n,
respectively, and whose nth "cdr" matches P_n+1; or

<LI>

P is of the form
<SAMP>`(P_1 ... P_n P_n+1 &#60;ellipsis&#62;)'</SAMP>
where &#60;ellipsis&#62; is the identifier <SAMP>`...'</SAMP>
and F is
a proper list of at least n forms, the first n of which match
P_1 through P_n, respectively, and each remaining element of F
matches P_n+1; or

<LI>

P is a vector of the form <SAMP>`#(P_1 ... P_n)'</SAMP>
and F is a vector
of n forms that match P_1 through P_n; or

<LI>

P is of the form
<SAMP>`#(P_1 ... P_n P_n+1 &#60;ellipsis&#62;)'</SAMP>
where &#60;ellipsis&#62; is the identifier <SAMP>`...'</SAMP>
and F is a vector of n
or more forms the first n of which match
P_1 through P_n, respectively, and each remaining element of F
matches P_n+1; or

<LI>

P is a datum and F is equal to P in the sense of
the <SAMP>`equal?'</SAMP> procedure.

</UL>

<P>
It is an error to use a macro keyword, within the scope of its
binding, in an expression that does not match any of the patterns.


<P>
When a macro use is transcribed according to the template of the
matching &#60;syntax rule&#62;, pattern variables that occur in the
template are replaced by the subforms they match in the input.
Pattern variables that occur in subpatterns followed by one or more
instances of the identifier
<SAMP>`...'</SAMP> are allowed only in subtemplates that are
followed by as many instances of <SAMP>`...'</SAMP>.
They are replaced in the
output by all of the subforms they match in the input, distributed as
indicated.  It is an error if the output cannot be built up as
specified.


<P>
Identifiers that appear in the template but are not pattern variables
or the identifier
<SAMP>`...'</SAMP> are inserted into the output as literal identifiers.  If a
literal identifier is inserted as a free identifier then it refers to the
binding of that identifier within whose scope the instance of
<SAMP>`syntax-rules'</SAMP> appears.
If a literal identifier is inserted as a bound identifier then it is
in effect renamed to prevent inadvertent captures of free identifiers.


<P>
As an example, if <CODE>let</CODE> and <CODE>cond</CODE> are defined as in
<A NAME="IDX166"></A>
<A NAME="IDX167"></A>
section <A HREF="r5rs_9.html#SEC80">7.3 Derived expression types</A> then they are hygienic (as required) and
the following is not an error.



<PRE>
<TT>(let ((=&#62; #f))
  (cond (#t =&#62; 'ok)))                  ==&#62; ok
</TT>
</PRE>

<P>
The macro transformer for <SAMP>`cond'</SAMP> recognizes <SAMP>`=&#62;'</SAMP>
as a local variable, and hence an expression, and not as the
top-level identifier <SAMP>`=&#62;'</SAMP>, which the macro transformer treats
as a syntactic keyword.  Thus the example expands into



<PRE>
<TT>(let ((=&#62; #f))
  (if #t (begin =&#62; 'ok)))
</TT>
</PRE>

<P>
instead of



<PRE>
<TT>(let ((=&#62; #f))
  (let ((temp #t))
    (if temp ('ok temp))))
</TT>
</PRE>

<P>
which would result in an invalid procedure call.
